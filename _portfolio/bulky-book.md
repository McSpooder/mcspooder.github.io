Introduction:

Embarking on a learning journey with the ".NET Core MVC - The Complete Guide 2023 [E-commerce app]" course is like stepping onto a path of transformation. This course has been a pivotal experience that has opened up a world of possibilities in the realm of web development.


A Foundation Laid in 3-6 Months:
In just a span of 3-6 months, armed with prior knowledge of C#, I set foot on this educational odyssey. I quickly realized that this course was designed for both beginners and those already acquainted with ASP.NET. The course began by unraveling the intricacies of ASP.NET Core, offering me a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of this powerful framework.

Building Projects, Unraveling Concepts:
With the basics firmly in place, I dived into practical application, building not one, but two projects. The first was a small Razor application that honed CRUD operations using Entity Framework. This was the crucible where theoretical knowledge fused seamlessly with hands-on experience, setting the stage for the grand project that lay ahead.

Bulky Book Website:
As the course progressed, so did my expertise. The Bulky Book website was more than just a project; it was a canvas where advanced ASP.NET MVC Core concepts were masterfully applied. The integration of Identity Framework, Entity Framework with code-first migrations, and interactions with Razor class library for Identity all came together in this monumental endeavor.

A Toolbox Expanded:
Along the way, my toolkit expanded exponentially. From Sessions and Custom Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core to View Components and Partial Views, the course ensured a comprehensive understanding of the framework's diverse features. Bootstrap v5 breathed life into the website, adding a touch of elegance to the functionality.

Authentication, Authorization, and More:
The course delved deep into the world of security and user management. I became adept at Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core. Google and Facebook login integration, along with Role Management in ASP.NET Core Identity, provided the course's practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Payment Gateways and Beyond:
Stripe Payment Integration was the final piece of the puzzle. This not only enriched my skill set but also added a layer of practicality, opening doors to potential e-commerce ventures.

Database Management and Deployment:
The course didn't stop at development. I became proficient in using the Repository Pattern to access the database, ensuring efficiency and maintainability. Seed Database Migrations, a critical aspect of database management, became second nature. Finally, deploying the website on Microsoft Azure and IIS brought a sense of accomplishment that reverberated through the entire journey.

Conclusion:

Completing the ".NET Core MVC - The Complete Guide 2023 [E-commerce app]" course has been nothing short of a transformational experience for me. In a span of just a few months, I evolved from a novice to a proficient developer, equipped with a powerful arsenal of skills and knowledge. This course is a testament to the potential that lies within each of us, waiting to be unlocked through the right guidance and dedication. With my newfound expertise, I am poised to take on the world of web development with confidence and creativity.

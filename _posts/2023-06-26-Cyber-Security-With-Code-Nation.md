As I reflect on the whirlwind four weeks of the Develop: Cyber course, I'm astounded at how far I've come. From a novice with limited technical knowledge to a certified Cyber Security Specialist, this journey has been nothing short of transformative.

Week 1: Diving into the World of Cyber Security
In my first week, the gravity of cyber threats and their potential consequences became abundantly clear. The course meticulously covered the various types of threats that systems face and the profound impact they can have on individuals and organizations alike. It was an eye-opening experience that set the tone for the weeks ahead.

Week 2: Mastering the Tools of the Trade
As the second week unfolded, I delved into the realm of cyber professional tools. Through hands-on labs and activities, I gained a deep understanding of how to safeguard networked systems and data. Exploring the lifecycle of a cyber exploit, from inception to completion, provided me with invaluable insights into the tactics used by cyber adversaries.

Week 3: Crafting a Secure Future
Week three was a pivotal moment in my journey. I delved into policies and procedures crucial for system security, as well as the legal framework that governs cyber practices. The highlight was undoubtedly the extended project focused on defending an online system. I had the opportunity to explore a working security system, strategize its fortification, and rigorously test its resilience. The sense of accomplishment upon completion was immeasurable.

Week 4: Navigating Compliance and Sealing Success
In the final stretch of the course, I honed my understanding of the legal landscape that underpins cyber security, with a special emphasis on the significance of GDPR compliance. The week culminated in thorough revision for the Level 2 exam, which I tackled head-on on the course's final day.

The Result: A Transformed Cyber Security Specialist
Today, I stand not only armed with newfound knowledge and skills but also holding three accredited qualifications. The Develop: Cyber course not only equipped me with technical prowess but also instilled a deep sense of confidence in my ability to navigate the complex world of cyber security.

My portfolio of evidence, crafted meticulously over the four weeks, serves as a testament to my practical proficiency. It's a tangible representation of the growth and determination that defined this course for me.

As I look ahead, I'm excited to apply my expertise in the field, knowing that this course has laid the foundation for a successful career in Cyber Security. The Develop: Cyber course has truly been a game-changer, propelling me into a future of boundless opportunities in the ever-evolving world of cyber security.

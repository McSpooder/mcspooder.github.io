I am thrilled to share that I've just completed the Digital Edge Programme, and the experience has been nothing short of transformative. If you've ever dreamt of venturing into the dynamic world of technology, this programme is your golden ticket.

From the outset, it was clear that Digital Edge was tailored for individuals like me who already had a foundation in computer knowledge. Instead of rehashing the basics, the programme provided me with the essential tools to take that crucial first step towards a tech career.

Over the course of eight engaging sessions spread across four weeks, I delved into a world of remote pre-employment and pre-apprenticeship training, all generously supported by Microsoft. The insights I gained were invaluable; they not only broadened my understanding of digital apprenticeships and entry-level IT positions but also provided me with a chance to connect with Microsoft employees and learn about their incredible journeys into the tech industry.

What truly sets this programme apart is the emphasis on hands-on learning. Through individual and team-based projects, I was able to apply my newfound knowledge in practical scenarios. This approach not only solidified my understanding but also ignited a sense of confidence in my abilities.

The support provided throughout the programme was unparalleled. I had access to a vast library of online courses, allowing me to tailor my learning to areas that resonated with me the most. The programme also honed in on essential employability skills, ensuring I was well-prepared to tackle the competitive tech job market.

One of the standout features of Digital Edge is the continued support offered post-completion. For up to six months, I'll have one-on-one employability support, which is invaluable as I navigate towards my future career goals.

If you're between 18 and 45, have a good grasp of computer skills, and possess a burning desire to dive into the digital and tech sphere, this programme is tailor-made for you. All you need is a laptop or desktop with internet access, and the doors to a future in technology swing wide open.

Completing the Digital Edge Programme has not only equipped me with the skills and knowledge to embark on a tech career, but it has also instilled in me a profound sense of confidence and determination. The journey was challenging, enlightening, and ultimately, incredibly rewarding. I am now poised to seize the countless opportunities that await in the ever-evolving world of technology.

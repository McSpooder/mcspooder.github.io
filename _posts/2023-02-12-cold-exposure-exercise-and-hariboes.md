Today is the 12th of February in the year 2023. Waking up was easy today which may have been due to a couple of reasons. Dinner wasnâ€™t eaten the day prior, cold exposure was utilised at night and exercise was performed close to bed time. 

1.1 Food
There is a lot of junk food in the house. After eating eat it hunger loses its effect and hence it is easier to skip dinner. Also, a lot of cold water was drank yesterday which contributed to the feeling of satiety. So much was drank that it looked like a three course meal was consumed.

Also for lunch a chicken chowmein was eaten. However, 

1.2 Exercise
Because of the cold water, the body temperature began falling. In order to remedy this functional strength training (calisthenics) along with breathing exercises were utilised. It mostly consisted of pushups and planches and wim hof for breathing. Hearth rate was monitored at all times to make sure that it was above 100 bpm in order to increase body temperature.

1.2.1
Inclined push ups 

	exponential repetitions: the powers of two were perfomed: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
	left to right swaying: once in the push up position swaying from left to right
	hiit: doing push ups fast to maximize the number of repetitions
	holds: stopping at the top and feeling the burn
1.2.2 Planches
When doing the planche different positions were employed to maximise time under stress for the abdominal and leg muscles.
	Elbow Planche
	Side Planche
	Leg up planches
	Push ups planche

1.3. Cold exposure
Although the exercise was used to offset the cold feeling that arose from drinking cold water it was still done in such a way that the body tempe	rature would be lower than resting. i.e. exercise was only used to increase the body temperature to not feel cold whilst remaining under the normal temperature of ~31deg.

Also, clothing was removed so that all the heat could escape. Removing clothes at night is quite unusual as the weather becomes cold anyway, This would have served as the biggest component in the cold exposure procedure. 

A cold shower was considered but it seemed like a little bit of an overkill at this point. Maybe in the future when the body gets more adjusted to the cold in unpredictable times.
